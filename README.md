The aim of this project is to create a user-friendly system that allows users to find various tourist
attractions in İstanbul. In this context, the application is going to store popular cafes, restaurants, and
must-visit attractions of İstanbul. In addition, based on the user input, the most relevant interests in these
three categories will be listed. Moreover, users can post comments under the attractions and rate them by
creating accounts. Lastly, the database will contain addresses, rates, photographs, and other relative
information that could help the users choose their destination.
